Since IT classes in Germany count keystrokes to score a keyboard typing test and not letters, I was asked to write that script.

eG. 'A' is two key strokes since you have to push 'shift' + 'a'.  

If you want to use the .exe in the windowsfolder, you might need to install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
